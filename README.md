📁 iCoder – A Responsive Blog Template Using Bootstrap
This project, iCoder, is a fully responsive blog template built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It is a simple yet clean and elegant website that simulates a professional blog or news portal layout. Through this project, I explored and applied various core concepts of front-end web development, especially focusing on responsive design with Bootstrap.

The main objective of creating this project was to enhance my understanding of Bootstrap's grid system, components, and layout structuring. Even though similar templates exist and this type of project has been around for a while, I believe that rebuilding and implementing it on my own provided me with valuable practical knowledge. It helped me grasp how to use Bootstrap classes efficiently, how to structure web pages using containers, rows, and columns, and how to make websites responsive across different devices.

The website includes a navigation bar, carousel, card components, and footer – all designed using Bootstrap. The design is clean, minimalistic, and suitable for personal blogs, tech articles, or portfolio posts. This hands-on practice helped me connect theory with actual implementation and boosted my confidence in using Bootstrap in future projects.

While working on iCoder, I also learned how to customize default Bootstrap styles, structure reusable components, and improve readability and responsiveness. I also made sure the website performs well on various screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop.

📌 Why This Project?
I created this project as part of my personal learning journey. Even though the idea and layout are simple, building it helped me strengthen my basics in front-end web development. Uploading this to GitHub marks a step in my progress and acts as a portfolio piece to demonstrate my ability to structure and design a responsive website.

This project is not only a demo of my Bootstrap learning but also motivation to keep creating and improving. I look forward to building more advanced and interactive web applications in the future.
